I happened to dredge up an old notebook and found a listing
of the PDP-7 version of dsw.  Because several people have approached
me recently about reviving a version of PDP-7 Unix as a sort of
paleontological exhibit, and because the subject has been discussed
here, I thought people might be interested in seeing the code.
I first considered net.sources, but decided not to carry whimsy too far.

		Dennis Ritchie

Notes:

1) The assembler has Knuth-style temporary labels but no literals.

2) The name of the current directory was evidently ".."

3) Formatting is faithfully reproduced.

4) "sys save" makes a core image.
